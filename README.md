Analysis of the Impact of Environmental Factors on Coral Reef Ecosystems
Acquisition of environmental factors: Firstly, we utilized tiqu.R to obtain salinity data from five sampling points of the nearshore coral reefs of Hainan Island on the EU's Global Ocean Physics Analysis and Forecasting (GOPAF) ocean satellite (https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/GLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_001_024/download). Secondly, we used tiqu1.R to obtain the Chlorophyll_a(Chl_a), KineticsÂ Dependent, Photosynthetically Active Radiation, Particulate Inorganic Carbon, Particulate Organic Carbon and Sea Surface Temperature at the corresponding points on the OceanColor data website (https://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/l3/order/).Finally, we combined the two sets of data into a new environmental data table.
Analysis of the Impact of Environmental Factors on the Nearshore Coral Reef Ecosystem in Hainan: Firstly, by calculating the correlation matrix between environmental factors and ecological indicators, multiple regression analysis is conducted on each ecological indicator and environmental factors, and standardized coefficients are extracted. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimension of environmental variables and identify the main environmental factors affecting the coral reef ecosystem. Secondly, we standardize the coefficients of each associated index, calculate the comprehensive mean score, and identify the consistently important environmental factors in different analytical methods. Finally, the generalized additive Model (GAM) is utilized to detect whether there is a nonlinear relationship among the variables.
